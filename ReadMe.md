This is a one liner with some questions that will do all the heavy lifting when installing python.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silverace71/python-install-script/main/pyinstall.sh && sudo chmod +x pyinstall.sh && ./pyinstall.sh
```
headless install steps
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silverace71/python-install-script/main/sonohead.sh && sudo chmod +x sonohead.sh
```
then run ```./sonohead.sh``` and put the version that you want right after (i.e. ```./sonohead.sh 3.10.11```)
